LINGApp(Localized Interactive Nutrient-based Growth Application for Pediatrics) encourages healthy living by giving an appropriate meal plan for the parents that is beneficial to the nutritional needs of their child. Our vision is to create a user-friendly mobile application that allows parents to monitor the dietary status of the health and well-being of their children with ease and accuracy. The application will be able to determine the dietary status of their child based on the children's given BMI and from the acquired information, the application will provide a concrete meal plan to assist the parents and offer a helpful guide and personalized recommendations on how to obtain proper nourishment for their child.
